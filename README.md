# DistributedProgramingEdgeColoring

This assignment deals with parallel programming using the message passing model. In this assignment
you will construct parallel solutions to certain problems and implement them using the Message Passing
Interface: MPI in either C or C++.

Given an undirected graph G, nd a proper edge coloring of the graph using Delta(G) + 1 colors or fewer.
No 2 adjacent edges should have a same color. Delta(G) is the maximum degree of any vertex in G.
